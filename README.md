# apiTest
# Initial effort to use the CarlX API for Patron accounts.
# Problems with the WSDL file surface during testing, namely that updatePatron request provides a response that the WSDL file does not
# specify.
# This omission can lead to many errors with resulting error messages that greatly slow debugging sessions.
